                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The chapter "Висшият Содом" ("The Higher Sodom") offers a damning critique of the moral and ethical decay at the highest levels of the Bulgarian Communist Party during the socialist era. The narrator recounts his interactions with a writer-friend whose comfortable life stems from producing low-quality, commercial literature for the regime. The scene soon shifts to a revealing phone call, where the writer's apartment is commandeered by a powerful party official for a secret affair. This official is portrayed as an unscrupulous figure who abuses his authority to exploit others, including using state resources for personal pleasure. The phone call underscores how even private citizens feel compelled to participate in the corrupt system out of fear or necessity. <br><br>The chapter expands to a broader depiction of a corrupt ruling class, focusing on various high-ranking officials' sexual exploits. These men use their positions to seduce women, offering career advancements or luxurious trips abroad in exchange for sexual favours. Markov paints a vivid picture of how state power is misused, not only for political repression but also for personal indulgence, portraying the regime's leadership as deeply immoral. The chapter uses both direct examples and gossip to illustrate a society where opportunism and moral degradation reign, showing how those in power normalize such behaviour, and how even ordinary citizens become complicit in the system.&nbsp;</p>

                  <strong>Semantics and Word Choice</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Markov’s word choice is pointed and deliberate, using sharp, evocative language to reveal the corruption and moral bankruptcy of the Bulgarian elite. His tone is a mix of cynicism, irony, and moral outrage, conveying a deep disdain for the officials’ abuse of power and the perverse system that enables them. Through these choices, Markov critiques not only individual figures but the entire structure that allows such behaviour to thrive unchecked. <br><br>Derogatory descriptors: The title "Висшият Содом" directly invokes the biblical city of Sodom, known for its moral depravity, signalling  from the outset that the subject is steeped in corruption and decadence. This sets a condemnatory tone, suggesting that the behaviour of the elite mirrors this ancient symbol of sinful excess.&nbsp;Words like "псевдоисторически, псевдоприключенски романи" ("pseudo-historical, pseudo-adventure novels") emphasize the author’s disdain for the cultural products promoted by the regime, dismissing them as fake and devoid of substance. The prefix pseudo- adds a layer of falseness, underlining how the literary and artistic output lacks authenticity or merit.&nbsp;Terms such as "бърлога" ("den") and "любовница" ("mistress") contribute to an animalistic and base portrayal of the officials' secret affairs, likening their clandestine behaviours to something savage and uncivilized<br>&nbsp;<br>Submission and complicity: Markov subtly highlights the reluctance and resignation of ordinary citizens through phrases like "Трябва да му услужвам с квартирата" ("I have to help him with the apartment"), where the use of трябва ("have to") connotes an obligation or pressure to comply. This word choice reveals the underlying coercion and lack of agency felt by those who must serve the elite, despite being uncomfortable with the arrangement. The phrase "ще бъде щедро заплатено" ("will be generously paid") shows how the system of favours and silence is transactional, but the word "щедро" ("generously") adds a layer of irony, suggesting that such payments are intended to pacify or silence rather than as genuine rewards.<br><br> Cynicism:&nbsp;The recurring reference to the official as "сексуален герой" ("sexual hero") uses irony to suggest that these men are glorified within their own circles for their exploitative behaviour. The word герой (hero) is traditionally used to celebrate courage or valour, but in this context, it is heavily laden with sarcasm, indicating that their “achievements” are anything but honourable. Also,&nbsp;"командува цялата българска литература" ("commands all of Bulgarian literature") is an ominous phrase that suggests absolute control and manipulation. The word командува (commands) invokes a militaristic, authoritarian image, highlighting the oppressive power structure that dictates not just political life but cultural production as well.<br><br>Emotional tone: Markov’s use of the phrase "студено и презрително отношение" ("cold and contemptuous attitude") to describe how officials lead women into their affairs evokes both disgust and pity. This stark description of emotional detachment in the context of intimate encounters suggests the moral emptiness of the ruling elite and the dehumanizing nature of their power.&nbsp;The repeated emphasis on the officials' physical and financial excess, such as in "пътувания в чужбина" ("trips abroad") and "живееха с всички удобства" ("lived with all the comforts"), contrasts sharply with the everyday struggles of the average Bulgarian citizen. This contrast intensifies the reader's sense of injustice and highlights the hypocrisy of the regime's outward ideological claims.<br><br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Sentence Structure</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Markov’s sentence structure is carefully crafted to reflect both the intricate nature of the corruption in Bulgarian society and the narrator's emotional responses to it. The long sentences immerse the reader in the elaborate and grotesque system of exploitation, while the short ones deliver sharp, often biting insights that heighten the emotional impact. This combination enhances the critique of the moral decay within the elite, making the passage both intellectually and emotionally engaging.<br><br>The variation between long and short sentences mirrors the tension between the outward veneer of respectability and the inner moral collapse of the regime. The longer sentences capture the sprawling, almost systemic nature of corruption, while the shorter one’s act as moments of moral reckoning or emotional reaction. The pacing varies accordingly, with long sentences slowing down the narrative to ensure that the reader grasps the full extent of the decadence and corruption. In contrast, the short sentences quicken the pace at critical moments, often delivering a blow to the reader’s understanding of the depth of the depravity<br>&nbsp;<br>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Long Sentences</strong><strong><br></strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Markov frequently uses long, complex sentences filled with clauses and descriptive details. These sentences often mimic the weight of the corruption and moral decay he is describing. For example: “След това прекарали нощта заедно и на другия ден тя се намери на редакторско място, което не съответствуваше нито на образованието, нито на способностите й.” ("Afterward, they spent the night together, and the next day she found herself in an editorial position that matched neither her education nor her abilities.") This sentence, like many others, is expansive and dense with information, detailing the causal chain of events between sexual favours and professional rewards.<br>&nbsp;<br>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Short Sentences</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In contrast, Markov punctuates his narrative with shorter, punchier sentences to deliver moments of clarity or emotional impact. These short sentences often come at moments when the narrator’s disdain or frustration is most apparent: “Той не желае да заведе тайната си любовница в един от многото домове на ЦК или Политбюро в околностите на София, защото могат да го видят.” ("He doesn’t want to take his secret mistress to one of the many homes of the Central Committee or Politburo around Sofia because they might see him.") This shorter, direct sentence interrupts the flow of longer descriptions, creating a sense of immediacy. It sharpens the mood by emphasizing the cowardice and hypocrisy of the elite, breaking down their actions into simple, easily digestible moments of moral weakness.<br>&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Juxtaposition&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Markov’s frequent juxtaposition of long, elaborate sentences with short, direct ones adds rhythm to the text. For instance: “Най-мръсното чувство беше, че те знаеха за какво идвам и ме водеха към спалнята на своя шеф със студено и презрително отношение...” ("The dirtiest feeling was that they knew why I was coming and led me to their boss’s bedroom with cold and contemptuous attitudes...") This is followed by a shorter, punchy conclusion: “Те дори не се преструваха, че не знаят.” ("They didn’t even pretend not to know.") <br><br>This transition from a long, emotionally laden sentence to a curt, factual statement tightens the focus and underscores the dehumanization and humiliation of the woman in the scenario. The abruptness of the short sentence intensifies the coldness of the scene, leaving an emotional punch after the slow build of the previous longer sentence.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Figurative Language</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Markov's use of metaphor, simile, and imagery in this passage serves not only to expose the moral and ethical corruption of the elite but also to reflect the narrator’s deep sense of disillusionment and disgust. The biblical metaphor of Sodom, the animalistic imagery, and the vivid descriptions of excess and manipulation reveal a society steeped in hypocrisy and moral decay. These devices reinforce the narrator’s internal experience of alienation and revulsion, as well as the central theme of the abuse of power within the Communist regime.<br><br>Sodom: The very title, "Висшият Содом", is a metaphor that draws on the biblical city of Sodom, notorious for its wickedness and immorality. Markov’s use of "Sodom" immediately sets the tone, equating the behaviour of the political elite with the degeneracy of a fallen city. This metaphor suggests that the highest levels of power in Bulgaria are steeped in sexual and moral corruption, positioning the Communist leadership as irredeemably compromised. By invoking this image, the narrator frames the regime not just as politically corrupt, but as morally bankrupt, creating a bleak emotional backdrop.  This comparison reveals the narrator’s disgust and moral outrage. The use of "Sodom" is a stark indication that, in the narrator's view, the ruling class has fallen beyond redemption, with their sins permeating the very fabric of society.<br><br>Servitude and Shame: The narrator shares a personal account where a woman describes being led by security officers to her lover’s bed. The officers escort her with a "студено и презрително отношение" ("cold and contemptuous attitude"), with the scene evoking feelings of public humiliation. This moment is metaphorically likened to a kind of public ritual, where even the intimate becomes a spectacle of power and control.  This metaphor encapsulates the dehumanizing effects of power. The woman’s shame and the indifference of the officials reflect how personal agency and dignity are lost in this corrupt system. The narrator seems to empathize with this sense of degradation, reflecting his own frustration with how power reduces individuals to mere objects within a larger system of control.&nbsp;<br><br>The "den of lust": The narrator makes indirect comparisons between the secret meetings of high-ranking officials and a "den of lust," where sexual favours are traded for political and material gain. While the simile isn’t always directly stated, the language and imagery surrounding these transactions imply a hidden, animalistic world that contrasts sharply with the public image of Communist leaders. For instance, officials are described as avoiding the state’s own properties for fear of being seen, instead retreating to private homes like "денове" ("dens"). This comparison creates a sharp contrast between the public facade of these men as ideological leaders and their private indulgence in illicit behaviour. This simile reveals the narrator's deep cynicism. It shows that he sees the political system as being driven not by ideology or collective good, but by selfish, animalistic urges that are hidden behind a veneer of respectability. This reflects the narrator’s disillusionment with the entire political apparatus, which pretends to serve the people while feeding its own desires.<br><br>Animalia: There is frequent use of imagery that likens the actions of the elite to those of animals or creatures driven by base instincts. For instance, the word "бърлога" ("den") is used to describe the apartment being used for illicit affairs, conjuring an image of a hidden lair where unsavoury activities take place. A "den" is associated with animals, emphasizing secrecy, and survival instincts rather than human decency. By using such imagery, the narrator distances the corrupt elite from civilized human behaviour, associating them with creatures that act on impulse, further underscoring his contempt for their lack of moral and social restraint. This also reflects his sense of alienation from the corrupt society that surrounds him, as if he views their world as inhuman or primal.<br><br>Excesses: The narrator frequently describes the luxurious lifestyles of the elite in material and sensual terms, painting a vivid image of excess. For instance, officials use state resources to fund extravagant trips abroad, frequent expensive hotels, and engage in lavish dining, all of which are funded by the state ("джоба на държавата" - "the state’s pocket"). This imagery of indulgence contrasts sharply with the hardships of ordinary citizens, emphasizing the disparity between the powerful and the powerless. This imagery highlights the theme of hypocrisy, where the Communist leadership, who claim to be the protectors of the proletariat, are in fact living in luxury. The detailed descriptions of wealth and indulgence serve to sharpen the narrator's critique of the regime’s moral duplicity.<br><br>Manipulation and Control: Throughout the passage, the narrator emphasizes the systemic nature of control through imagery of manipulation. Officials like другаря К (Comrade K) use their political influence to make or break careers, highlighting how personal lives are manipulated for professional or sexual gain. The imagery of manipulation and control runs parallel to the broader theme of the abuse of power. This imagery aligns with the broader theme of exploitation within the narrative. The powerful exploit their positions for personal gratification, and the system itself enables this exploitation, trapping both the powerful and powerless in a cycle of corruption and dependency.<br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Through a post-colonial lens, "Висшият Содом" can be examined as a critique of the internal colonization by the Communist Party in Bulgaria, where the ruling elite subjugates its own population through political and moral corruption. The imagery of sexual exploitation and power imbalances reflects a kind of internal colonialism, where the ruling class assumes a colonial power over the bodies and lives of ordinary citizens, much as an external colonizer might exploit colonized subjects. The elite's indulgence in Western luxuries—trips to Paris, expensive hotels, and foreign affairs—also highlights a form of post-colonial mimicry. Despite promoting socialist ideals, they crave the very capitalist luxuries they publicly reject, revealing their complicity in Western consumerism while maintaining oppressive control over the local populace. The use of state resources for personal pleasure can be viewed as a continuation of imperial extractive practices, where the “colonizers” (in this case, the Party elite) drain national resources for personal gain.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Memory Studies</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In the context of memory studies, Markov's "Висшият Содом" serves as a testimony to the repressed and hidden histories of Bulgaria's socialist regime. The narrator’s detailed accounts of corruption, secret affairs, and the misuse of power become acts of memorialization, preserving a narrative that the regime sought to suppress. By recalling these events, the text acts as a counter-narrative to the official histories promoted by the Communist Party, which likely would have emphasized the moral purity and ideological commitment of its leaders. The use of gossip and personal anecdotes in the passage reflects the way collective memory in authoritarian regimes often relies on informal, subversive channels to survive. The narrator’s testimony, therefore, becomes an act of resistance, ensuring that the abuses of power and the moral decay of the leadership are not forgotten, even if they were not formally recorded in official historical records. </p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Affective Theory</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Through the lens of affective theory, the emotional landscape of "Висшият Содом" reveals the pervasive sense of disgust, shame, and humiliation that characterizes life under the corrupt Communist regime. The narrator’s descriptions of officials exploiting women and state resources evoke feelings of revulsion and moral outrage. Affective responses, such as the cold contempt of the officers escorting the woman to her lover's bed, underscore how power operates through emotional control, reducing individuals to objects of desire or tools for personal gain. The elites, meanwhile, are portrayed as detached from ordinary emotional engagement, using power and influence to manipulate others without concern for their feelings. The emotional tension between the ruling class’s indulgence and the narrator’s disgust highlights the disconnection between those in power and the broader population, amplifying the sense of betrayal and moral collapse that pervades the text. In this way, affect not only shapes individual experience but also reveals the broader emotional structure of a society built on exploitation and control.<br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-7"><strong>Narrative Voice</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The narrator in "Висшият Содом" exudes a voice that is both intimate and critical, marked by a deeply subjective perspective. His tone is infused with moral indignation and cynicism, as he offers a scathing critique of the Communist elite's corruption, sexual exploitation, and moral decay. This subjectivity is evident in his frequent use of personal anecdotes, gossip, and detailed observations about the private lives of high-ranking officials. The narrator speaks from a position of insider knowledge, sharing events that are typically hidden from public view, such as secret affairs and the use of state resources for personal pleasure. While this insider status lends credibility to his account, it also signals his subjective bias against the regime, which he clearly detests. <br><br>The narrator’s voice leans towards the unreliable, not in the sense of outright fabrication, but in its heavy reliance on rumours, personal opinion, and second-hand accounts. For instance, the narrator describes how one official is reputed to have seduced numerous women and traded sexual favours for career advancements, yet much of this is framed as "достоверни слухове" ("credible rumours"). This reliance on gossip to construct his narrative means that the reader must question the extent to which these accounts are factual, or whether they are exaggerated or filtered through the narrator’s personal contempt for the regime. <br><br>This subjective narrative perspective shapes the reader’s understanding by drawing them into a world of intrigue, secrecy, and moral duplicity. The narrator portrays the elite as morally bankrupt, which aligns the reader’s sympathy with the victims of their exploitation—women, writers, and ordinary citizens. However, because the narrative is so coloured by the narrator’s emotional responses—disgust, scorn, and even a sense of betrayal—it also invites the reader to view the events through a critical, albeit skewed, lens. The sharp tone, combined with detailed personal stories, suggests that the narrator is not just offering an objective report but is actively constructing a version of events that amplifies the regime’s immorality, thus reinforcing his subjective view. Consequently, the reader is guided to adopt the narrator’s critical stance, but with an awareness that this perspective may not capture the full complexity of the events or individuals involved.&nbsp;<br></p>
