                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The chapter "Спасителният смях" (The Saving Laughter) explores the profound role of humour in Bulgarian culture, especially under communist rule. Markov expresses deep admiration for the Bulgarian people's unique sense of humour, which combines self-irony with insightful political and social commentary. This humour, according to him, transcends mere laughter, serving as a critical lens through which Bulgarians evaluate their leaders and daily life under an oppressive regime. Markov argues that the people's ability to laugh at themselves, their circumstances, and even the absurdities of the ruling party allowed them to maintain a sense of dignity and resilience during times of great hardship. <br><br>The essay is filled with anecdotes that highlight how humour flourished in even the most repressive environments. Political jokes and satirical stories became a national genre, subtly mocking the incompetence and moral bankruptcy of party leaders. Markov recounts various jokes that circulated widely, showing how humour was a form of silent resistance. The piece ends by noting how the communist regime, aware of humour’s subversive power, attempted to suppress it, but ultimately failed. Despite the government's efforts, humour remained a powerful outlet for expressing hidden truths, helping people to preserve their humanity in the face of totalitarian control.&nbsp;</p>

                  <strong>Semantics and Word Choice</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Throughout the chapter, Markov uses carefully chosen words and phrases to convey his admiration for the resilience of the Bulgarian people through humour, while simultaneously critiquing the communist regime. Thus, through his word choice, Markov juxtaposes the vitality of the people's humour with the stupidity and rigidity of the communist system, ultimately suggesting that humour is both a survival tool and a weapon of critique against authoritarianism.&nbsp;<br><br>Admiration: Markov frequently employs positive, descriptive language when referring to the humour of the Bulgarian people. Phrases like "невероятното чувство за хумор" (the incredible sense of humour) and "блика от самите недра на народа" (flows from the very depths of the people) suggest a deep connection between humour and the core identity of the Bulgarian nation. Words such as "гордея" (proud) and "удивлявал" (amazed) indicate his esteem for this cultural characteristic. He emphasizes how humour is not just an intellectual exercise but is grounded in everyday folk wisdom, describing it as "дълбока народна философия" (deep popular philosophy). This reverence is further highlighted by his repeated mention of humour as a natural and spontaneous phenomenon, portraying it as an essential, almost instinctive, part of the national character.<br>&nbsp;<br>Disdain: In contrast, Markov's description of the communist regime and its leaders is laced with derision and sarcasm. He subtly mocks their lack of intelligence and detachment from the people through anecdotes about political leaders. For instance, in the joke about Enver Hoxha gripping the train window, the villagers humorously deduce that he’s afraid because he’s "навикнал да се държи за самара" (used to holding onto a donkey's saddle), painting him as unsophisticated and out of place in modernity. Here, Markov’s word choice underscores the absurdity of the regime, implying that its leaders are both foolish and out of touch.&nbsp;He also uses biting phrases like "невъзможна за четене партийна литература" (impossible-to-read party literature) and refers to the "печатаните партийни глупости" (printed party nonsense), which emphasizes his disdain for the hollow propaganda forced on the public. These phrases show the stark contrast between the ingenuity of the people's humour and the emptiness of the official discourse. <br><br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Sentence Structure</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                  Markov's strategic use of sentence structure—alternating between long, flowing reflections and short, sharp punchlines—enhances the pacing and mood of the passage. The long sentences allow for depth, contemplation, and admiration for the people’s enduring humour, while the short sentences create moments of comedic release, capturing the sharp wit of the Bulgarian people. This combination reinforces the central theme of the passage: humour as both a survival tool and a subtle act of resistance under a repressive regime.

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Long Sentences</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                  Markov frequently employs long, flowing sentences when recounting anecdotes or reflecting on the profound role of humour in Bulgarian society. For example, when describing the resilience of humour during hard times, he writes at length about how "в най-тежките времена... чувството за хумор... стана главен отдушник на болката и мъката" (in the most difficult times... humour became the main outlet for pain and suffering). This extended sentence mirrors the endurance and continuity of humour itself, reflecting how it pervades all aspects of life under communism.<br><br>By using long sentences, Markov creates a narrative flow that immerses the reader into his reflective tone, giving space for the complexities of Bulgarian humour to unfold. These longer sentences serve to emphasize the richness and depth of the humour he admires, while also reflecting the ongoing, uninterrupted presence of humour in the people’s lives. The pacing slows down in these moments, allowing the reader to absorb the philosophical weight of his observations.<br>&nbsp;<br>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Short Sentences</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In contrast, short sentences are often used to punctuate moments of humour or deliver punchlines in anecdotes. For instance, when recounting the joke about the villager questioning whether his friend had a head before the bear attack, the humour is sharp and clear, delivered through concise, punchy statements like "Па не знам дали Гюро имаше глава, или нямаше" (Well, I don’t know if Gyuro had a head or not). This abruptness heightens the comedic impact, creating a quick, light-hearted pace that contrasts with the more reflective moments in the text.<br><br>Additionally, in the political jokes, Markov uses short, direct sentences to mimic the laconic nature of the Bulgarian people’s humour. Sentences like "Къде е Вуте?" (Where is Vute?) and "Крава, която пасе в България, но я доят в СССР" (A cow that grazes in Bulgaria but is milked in the USSR) are quick, to-the-point, and laced with irony. These short, sharp phrases contribute to the dry, sardonic tone that defines the people’s resistance to the regime. The brevity of these sentences also reflects the efficiency of humour as a tool for critique—swift, sharp, and impactful.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The alternation between long and short sentences creates a dynamic pacing throughout the passage. Long sentences slow down the narrative, encouraging contemplation and highlighting the deep, enduring nature of humour in times of suffering. These moments feel philosophical and introspective, allowing Markov to demonstrate his profound respect for the resilience of the Bulgarian people. <br><br>On the other hand, short, punchy sentences quicken the pace during humorous anecdotes or jokes, contributing to a light, comedic mood. These brief sentences create moments of levity, providing sharp, humorous relief amidst the more reflective commentary. The quick transitions from longer, philosophical reflections to short, witty punchlines mimic the way humour itself operates in difficult circumstances—offering moments of brief but powerful release from oppression.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Figurative Language</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Through metaphors, similes, and vivid imagery, Markov highlights the absurdity of life under communism, the distance between rulers and the people, and the resilience of ordinary citizens. These literary devices reflect the narrator’s internal struggle with the oppressive regime while emphasizing his admiration for the Bulgarian people’s ability to endure through humour. Ultimately, these elements reinforce the book’s overarching themes of humour as a form of resistance, the absurdity of authoritarianism, and the importance of intellectual and emotional survival in the face of totalitarianism.<br><br>"Цялата форма на антидрамата е тук, в този трънски разказ" (The entire form of the anti-drama is here, in this Trun story): This metaphor compares a traditional Bulgarian folk tale to absurdist theatre, specifically the works of Ionesco. By invoking "anti-drama," Markov draws a parallel between the absurdity of daily life under communism and the nonsensical events in the story. The metaphor reflects how Bulgarian’s cope with the irrational and contradictory nature of their political reality through humour, revealing the narrator's internal experience of bewilderment in such an oppressive environment. It suggests that the absurdity in Bulgarian life under totalitarianism mirrors a larger existential absurdity, reinforcing the theme that laughter becomes a way to survive the illogical nature of power. <br><br>"Животът така често свири едновременно на струните на сълзите и на смеха" (Life so often plays simultaneously on the strings of tears and laughter): This metaphor blends music with the emotional duality of life in Bulgaria, portraying existence as a musical instrument that evokes both sorrow and joy. The imagery of "strings" being plucked for both emotions reveals the intertwined nature of tragedy and comedy in the narrator’s view of life under an oppressive regime. It encapsulates the resilience of the Bulgarian people, suggesting that even in the face of hardship, they find ways to laugh. This emphasizes the theme of humour as a coping mechanism for enduring pain, a central idea in the book.&nbsp;<br><br>"Крава, която пасе в България, но я доят в СССР" (A cow that grazes in Bulgaria but is milked in the USSR): This simile compares Bulgaria to a cow being exploited by the Soviet Union. The image conveys the economic and political subjugation of Bulgaria, portraying the country as providing resources (the cow’s grazing) while those in power (the USSR) extract the benefits (milking the cow). The simile reinforces Markov’s critique of the communist system, highlighting the imbalance of power and the exploitation of Bulgarian resources and labour by the Soviet regime. It also suggests the futility of local efforts since the benefits of Bulgarian labour are siphoned off by a distant power. <br><br>"Влакът премина покрай нас, недалеч от село Дивотино" (The train passed by us, not far from the village of Divotino): Though not a direct simile, the image of the train passing by without interaction, while a political leader clings tightly to the window, evokes a feeling of distance and isolation between the people and their rulers. The scene suggests that political figures are disconnected from the reality of ordinary citizens, and the image of the leader holding on "out of fear" reflects the fear-driven governance that characterizes authoritarian regimes. This imagery serves to enhance the theme of detachment and incompetence of political leadership, which contrasts with the wisdom and humour of the common people.<br><br>&nbsp;"Той се надигна, засмя се и каза: „Цял живот исках да се повозя на такси и даде Господ, навозих се!“" (He got up, laughed, and said: "All my life I wanted to ride in a taxi, and God granted it to me—I got my fill of it!"). This imagery portrays a man who has been beaten and thrown out of a taxi, yet his response is laughter. The juxtaposition of violence and humour captures the stoic resilience of the Bulgarian people. The image of the beaten man, finding humour in his situation, reflects a theme of enduring suffering through irony, showing how the oppressed find ways to mentally liberate themselves even in physical hardship. It also demonstrates the narrator's recognition of this spirit of perseverance that exists among ordinary citizens, offering insight into his deep admiration for their strength <br><br>"Много обичам книгите… сума нещо съм прочел, като бях в гробищата…" (I love books... I read a lot when I worked in the cemetery...). This line evokes a strange, ironic imagery of a graveyard worker reading literature amidst the dead. The setting of a cemetery creates a powerful contrast between the intellectual activity of reading and the presence of death. It reflects the idea that even in environments associated with mortality and despair, Bulgarians find ways to engage with culture and knowledge. The narrator’s use of this imagery suggests a theme of finding light in dark places, reinforcing the notion that humour, reading, and intellectual engagement serve as escapes from the harsh realities of life under authoritarian rule.<br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Through the lens of post-colonial theory, “The Saving Laughter” can be interpreted as a critique of the colonial dynamics between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. The simile comparing Bulgaria to a cow that "grazes in Bulgaria but is milked in the USSR" illustrates the exploitation and subjugation that Bulgaria experienced under Soviet hegemony, akin to a colonial relationship where local resources are extracted for the benefit of the imperial power. Markov’s depiction of Bulgarian humour as a tool of resistance parallels the ways in which colonized peoples often use cultural practices, such as satire and folk narratives, to subtly challenge dominant powers. In this context, humour becomes a form of cultural sovereignty, preserving a national identity that resists the homogenizing force of Soviet influence. The jokes about incompetent leaders and the absurdities of the political system can be seen as a post-colonial expression of resistance, where the oppressed mock the authority of their occupiers in an attempt to reclaim agency in an otherwise controlled and exploited space.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">From the perspective of memory studies, the passage reflects how collective memory is preserved through humour, jokes, and anecdotes, particularly during periods of repression. Markov’s anecdotes capture not only individual experiences but also the shared historical consciousness of Bulgarians under communism. The recurring theme of laughter as a survival mechanism highlights how cultural memory can be shaped and transmitted through unofficial, informal channels such as humour, which becomes a repository for remembering the hardships of the regime. This is evident in Markov’s recounting of political jokes, which serve as mnemonic devices that encode both the suffering and the resilience of the people. These jokes, passed orally from person to person, act as a form of cultural documentation that resists the official narratives propagated by the regime. By preserving memories of oppression and absurdity, humour plays a crucial role in shaping historical memory, keeping alive the experiences of those who lived through the regime. </p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4"><strong>Affective Theory</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Using affective theory, Markov’s exploration of humour in the face of suffering can be analysed as a study of how emotions and affect shape and respond to political oppression. The juxtaposition of "tears and laughter" in everyday life speaks to the complex emotional landscape of living under a repressive regime, where emotions such as fear, frustration, and anger are often sublimated into humour. In affective terms, laughter in this context serves as a release valve for the emotional pressure generated by totalitarian control. It becomes a way to manage affective responses to violence, injustice, and absurdity, turning what could be debilitating emotions into something empowering. The collective act of sharing jokes creates a community of affect, where the shared laughter not only bonds individuals together but also subtly critique and resists the regime. This emotional solidarity suggests that humour does more than provide escape—it becomes a form of affective resistance, a way for people to assert their emotional agency in a space otherwise dominated by fear and repression.<br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-7"><strong>Narrative Voice</strong></h3>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The narrator exhibits a voice that is both subjective and reliable in different ways. The subjectivity stems from the personal, anecdotal nature of the recounting. Markov narrates from a first-person perspective, frequently using personal pronouns such as “аз” (I) and recounting his own experiences with humour and oppression. This subjectivity is evident in his emotional investment in the subject matter, particularly when he expresses admiration for the Bulgarian people's resilience or disdain for the communist regime. His tone often combines irony, nostalgia, and critique, which colours the narrative with his personal interpretations of events. For instance, his reflections on Bulgarian humour as a source of pride and his description of political leaders as foolish convey not only facts but also his personal judgments about the state of society. <br><br>However, while the narrator’s perspective is clearly personal and subjective, he can still be seen as reliable in terms of presenting a truthful portrayal of life under communism. His use of detailed anecdotes and authentic cultural references, such as the recounting of popular jokes and the everyday experiences of citizens, lends credibility to his narrative. The reliability of the narrator comes from the fact that his observations resonate with the collective experience of Bulgarians at the time, making his account feel authentic even though it is filtered through his personal lens. The use of humour and satire allows the narrator to convey unspoken truths about the political system, truths that would have been widely recognized but rarely openly stated. In this way, his subjectivity does not undermine his reliability but rather enhances it by providing a cultural and emotional context that helps the reader understand the significance of the events being described. <br><br>The narrative perspective shapes the reader’s understanding of events by offering both a critical lens on the absurdity of the regime and a celebration of the people’s resistance through humour. By interspersing personal anecdotes with broader cultural commentary, the narrator gives the reader an insider’s view of life under communism, emphasizing how humour functions as both a survival tool and a form of subversive resistance. This perspective guides the reader to view the oppressive regime not just through the lens of political critique but through the lens of everyday life, where humour becomes a form of empowerment and an emotional outlet for the oppressed.&nbsp;<br></p>
